### Helloooo üëã

My name is Ben (he/him) and I am a Solutions Engineer at GitHub. I love to help people. I also love games üéÆ

#### Here are some projects I am proud of 
1. [Nectar of the Gods](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1421410/Nectar_of_the_Gods/): An unquenchable multiplayer strategy game where bugs clash over the sweet nectar of sugary beverages.
2. [Facepunch.Steamworks Tutorial](https://github.com/bthomas2622/facepunch-steamworks-tutorial): A Unity tutorial for the open source *Facepunch.Steamworks* C# Steamworks wrapper.
