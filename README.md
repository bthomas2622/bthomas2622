### Helloooo 👋

My name is Ben (he/him) and I am a Solutions Engineer at GitHub. I love to help people. I also love baking 🍞 and games 🎮

#### Here are some projects I am proud of: 
- **[Nectar of the Gods](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1421410/Nectar_of_the_Gods/)**: An unquenchable multiplayer strategy game where bugs clash over the sweet nectar of sugary beverages.
- **[Facepunch.Steamworks Tutorial](https://github.com/bthomas2622/facepunch-steamworks-tutorial)**: A Unity tutorial for the open source *Facepunch.Steamworks* C# Steamworks wrapper. 
- **[Unity 2D Starter Kit](https://github.com/bthomas2622/unity-2d-starter-kit)**: Unity 2020 2D Starter Kit Project. Contains a main menu with base features implemented like input handling, player settings, audio, and localization.
- **[Game Development Blog](http://bthomas2622.github.io/gamedevblog/index.html)**: A blog about my journey creating **[Nectar of the Gods](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1421410/Nectar_of_the_Gods/)**.
- **[Colony Collapse Disorder](http://bthomas2622.github.io/bee-game/welcomeScreen.html)**: Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is a procedurally generated adventure game where you play as an Oakland bee scouring a flower field.
