### Helloooo üëã

My name is Ben (he/him) and I am a Solutions Engineer at GitHub. I love to help people. I also love baking üçû and games üéÆ

#### Here are some projects I am proud of: 
- **[Nectar of the Gods](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1421410/Nectar_of_the_Gods/)**: An unquenchable multiplayer strategy game where bugs clash over the sweet nectar of sugary beverages.
- **[Facepunch.Steamworks Tutorial](https://github.com/bthomas2622/facepunch-steamworks-tutorial)**: A Unity tutorial for the open source *Facepunch.Steamworks* C# Steamworks wrapper. 
- **[Unity 2D Starter Kit](https://github.com/bthomas2622/unity-2d-starter-kit)**: Unity 2020 2D Starter Kit Project. Contains a main menu with base features implemented like input handling, player settings, audio, and localization.
- **[Game Development Blog](http://bthomas2622.github.io/gamedevblog/index.html)**: A blog about my journey creating **[Nectar of the Gods](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1421410/Nectar_of_the_Gods/)**.
- **[Colony Collapse Disorder](http://bthomas2622.github.io/bee-game/welcomeScreen.html)** (**[GitHub](https://github.com/bthomas2622/bee-game)**) is a procedurally generated adventure game where you play as an Oakland bee scouring a flower field.
- **[Photography Portfolio](https://www.flickr.com/photos/150766453@N07/sets/72157683816082526/)**
- **[Bread Log](https://bthomas2622.github.io/bread-log/)** (**[GitHub](https://github.com/bthomas2622/bread-log)**) is my sourdough bread log! A wheaty harvest of recipe reactions, learnings, reviews and crumb comparisons.
- **[freeBrunch's Discord Bot](https://github.com/bthomas2622/freebrunch-discord-bot)** is a Discord Bot designed to run on a self hosted server (e.g. raspberry pi). It generates random Apex Legends champions and other fun stuff!
